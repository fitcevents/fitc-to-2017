## **What is open source?**

Software that can be freely used, modified, and shared (either modified or unmodified) by anyone

**History of Open Source**
History of open source is intertwined with this history of Mozilla

- *The Cathedral and the Baza**a**r* -  essay by Eric S. Raymond, presented in 1997
  - Raymond observed there were two predominant models of software: 
    - The Cathedral model: Code is developed in a closed environment and contributions can be made only by an exclusive group of developers
    - The Bazaar model: Development is a transparent process and contributions are open to the public
- Raymond’s essay inspired Netscape to release their browser suite as open source software in 1998, which becomes the Mozilla Project


**Open Source Leadership Principles**
A) Invite participation
B) Share decision making
C) Share code and content

## **What is mentorship?**
- A relationship where someone with more knowledge and experience provides support, guidance, and inspiration
- Fuels growth in open source
- Has the potential to change thinking and process around how we work
## **How mentoring open source can change the world**

**Multiplying open leaders**

- Mentoring project leads proliferates more mentors who can support, guide, and inspire other project leads

**Open Leadership Training Curriculum**
*A) Plan to Work Open*
Plan to build an open product and community from the outset


  - Open Canvas strategy exercise - one-page project and community plan (inspired by the Lean Canvas model)
      1. Identify 1-3 problems you want to solve
      2. Propose a solution for each project
      3. Identify key metrics
      4. Develop a project execution plan
        1. Identify resources required to build an MVP
        2. Describe contributor profiles - what types of contributions do you need? Who are the ideal contributors you want to attract?
      5. Describe user profiles 
      6. Develop a community engagement plan
        1. User channels - how to gain new users
        2. Contributor channels - how to gain new contributors
      7. Create a unique value proposition - what are you offering and why are you different?
      
  - Roadmap - identify where you are now, end goal, and how you’ll get there
      1. Pick milestones
      2. Break down tasks needed to reach each milestone
      

*B) Open Project Checklist*
The minimum infrastructure requirements for an open source project

  - Public code repository
  - Public issue trackking
  - Required files:
    - README.md
    - LICENSE
    - CONTRIBUTING.md
    - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

*C) Community Building*
Treat your community as a pipeline and come up with a plan for how you will guide someone through different levels of the pipeline.

**How to develop a community building strategy**

  1. Segment your community: define the types of members in your community
    - Users
    - Issue reporters
    - First-time contributors
    - Casual contributors 
    - Core contributors
    - Maintainers
  2. Start from the top: How are people entering the pipeline as users?
  3. Look at each step: How easy is it for users to transition to different levels of the pipeline? How can you help a user become a maintainer?
