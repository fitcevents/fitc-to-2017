# The Intersection of Fashion, Robotics and Technology

Anouk’s background: fashion design/engineering, and combines these together in her work. Started in fashion design at 13, and at 18, studied robotics. Began working with microcontrollers - this is what she works with primarily.

First project - working with Audi - hacked in and took the higher power lights from the car and placed them in her dress. Reacted against the displaced look of women in short shorts and tight clothes at car shows - found it humiliating and wanted to change their silhouette, make them look badass, drivers of the cars instead of standing beside them.

Cocktail dresses, that make cocktails, developed for Cirque du Soleil.

Main research: space around the body - Public / Social / Personal / Intimate Space and the intersection between these spaces. 

Inspiration: copies things that she sees in nature and adds them into her designs. A dress that looks like an octopus that injects smoke into the space. 

Modelled in Maya and uses a flexible 3D printing process called SLS technique to build the material for her dress.

**BioSignals:** uses a series of signals from the body (sensors that track heart rate, temperature, EEG, EMP) to connect her dresses to the environment that surrounds them.

**Gamifying Fashion:** Making fashion fun and accessible - in residency at Ars Electronica (https://www.aec.at/aeblog/en/2016/03/15/agent-unicorn/), building a device for children with ADHD. Learning about the P3 wave and how it triggers in a mohawk-looking wave, which inspired her to build a unicorn horn with a Realsense camera inside of it: as the tension of the child rises, the camera goes off to get a sense of how tense the child is. It doesn’t numb them or their feelings, instead educates them on how their brain works.

The colour nature of agent Unicorn puts children in a playful state, making it much easier to collect data from them. Impotant to Anouk because it makes medical treatment a little bit better.

Working at intel and using their smart wearable tech, came up with dress inspired by a spider. “The more degree of freedom a robot has, the more things you can do with it” - a spider has a lot of features that allow for freedom. As you move close it it, it will attack you! (“stay the fuck out of my space” Anouk says) (https://iq.intel.com/smart-spider-dress-by-dutch-designer-anouk-wipprecht/).

Whereas the smoke dress is more pear form, more flowy, the spider dress is built from bird/snake bones and has more of an ‘attacking’ feel to it.

‘Fashion as an interface - interface becomes a tool’

Fashion as community - the maker fair in the bay area for “grown up children”.  They reverse engineered the spider dress out of Logo. Also remade the cocktail dress at Roboxotica. Anouk loves the idea of people being inspired by her work - the importance of MAKING cool shit, and SHARING it with the community.

Fashion as a PLAYFUL interface
Fashion as a SOCIAL interface
Fashion as an EMOTIONAL Interface
