“We enter the world through our senses. By changing our relationship to them, we discover new worlds.”

Growing up in the mid-west with a French mother, created some differences for their family compared to others. Ate dinner at 8pm while others ate at 5pm. Had many plates and things set on the table as opposed to one. 

Started to notice a relationship between the times we ate and the rest of our lives. Increasingly began looking at food in all the ways we relate to it. 

Did an exercise that had audience partner up, plug each others noses and then place a candy in their partners mouth. Upon releasing the nose they were surprised at the flavour. Also asked everyone to plug ears and listen to the sounds of the candy in their mouths. The lesson: our senses depend on each other. Taste doesn’t work without smell.

This is essential to remember as designers. Changing the colour of something immediately changes our relationship to it. ie. change the colour of a candy and you expect it to taste different.

Again, growing up in middle America, was surrounded by junk food but not allowed to eat any of it.

For a Hack 2 Work challenge, she came up with five recipes that could be made with office snacks. This led to a book deal to make 50 recipes out of junk food. She began exploring all the junk staples of America to re-work them into fancy French inspired food. Started doing workshops, TV appearances, etc. 

Suddenly found herself quitting her agency job and looking at how to translate this to a career. Didn’t want to be the junk food queen so looked for a focus on exploring human experiences.

“Our dining tables are the stages where our daily lives unfold.” It’s the “theatre of life”.

**Delightful Tension**

- created table and chairs stretched over with spandex
- table had circular, solid peaks where glasses could be placed
- sitting and eating at the table caused this strange experience where not only were dinners floating in their chairs, but also the food to move, turning the display of food into it’s own performance

**Traces**
Created a meal that could only be eaten by hand

- began with a group hand washing ritual
- first course involved squirting a sauce across everyone’s hands
- all courses involved some sort of interaction with the food
- resulted in traces of food and sauce smeared everywhere - hence the name

Surprise(?!)

- this seems to be the thing many of us our constantly looking for in our lives
- it’s a driving motivator in Emilie’s work, to create surprise for the participants
- thinking of interaction design, a core principle is “show don’t tell” - what kinds of food interactions are completely intuitive to everyone: licking ice cream!
- created ice cream cones with capacitive sensors in them, when the ice cream cone is licked, it triggers audio
- became an individual and group performance of licking ice cream

**Popstars**

- a lickable, tourable performance of lickable microphone popsicles
- partnered with Dan Deacon to do a live performance of his music
- used Makey Makey’s tied to Ableton trickers

**Cotton Candy Theremin**

- while spinning cotton candy, an array of infrared sensors inside detect the movement and generate audio and control video display

Wonder - one of the things we can do, in this global crisis, is to continue to create wonder and emotion.
