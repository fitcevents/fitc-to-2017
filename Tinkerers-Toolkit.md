# Tinkerer's Toolkit
Stacey Mulcahy

“Sometimes stuff happens and you have to carry it with you and just keep going.”

“I always make some sort of life decision around the time of FITC” - in 2016 she made the move to move and run a maker shop, The Garage, at Microsoft Vancouver.

First task there: make gifts for Prime Minister and Mayor of Vancouver. Made laser engraved skateboards.

Found out Bill Gates was coming to visit the shop, so made an app in Processing to come up with an image, constructed it, and hung it up just in time for his visit. The next day while touring the space, Gates came to see the picture and posed with it. The next day was hit by the notion, what’s next, what do I do now?

**Tinker**

- inquisitive
- incurable

Stacey’s job is to help others be tinkers. To teach engineers to appreciate art, that creativity isn’t a place. To help people be creative who don’t have creativity instilled with them.

“Celebrate success that is not your own”
“Law of the instrument - you don’t only have one tool”
“Changing stuff and seeing what happens”

**Future Reality**
AR, VR & MR

- provide a full space of 360 cameras, green screens, VR headsets, etc
- [holo.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloJS) - creating mixed reality with js
- “future reality is just a part of the experience, not the experience itself”
- [Fluid Interfaces lab at MIT,](http://fluid.media.mit.edu/) as source of inspiration
- [Is WebVR Ready?](https://webvr.rocks/)

“The first time an engineer touches a tool, it changes the way they think and work.”
