# Everything I Know About Design Leadership...
Most of the time we think of design success in terms of “process”
But there’s something far more important than process - it’s people (i.e. the teams that are made)

For us designers, design is EXISTENTIAL.

If you have the vision to do something big with design, you will have to lead a team.

My first time managing a team was terrible.

**Lessons in Leadership. In nine innings.**

1. You are completely responsible, but you have no control
  1. As a coach, I don’t hit the ball (the players do).
  2. You can either go insane or inspire.
  3. As a design leader, you don’t make the wireframes, the comps, write the code. You can’t do everything. 
  4. You don’t get credit when your player gets home run or strikes out. But if your player continuously botches it, it’s your responsibility.
  5. Your job is to cultivate a team to deliver great design.
2. Everyone knows what you’re about
  1. Everyone knows what matters to you, what you care
  2. How you deal with your skilled players says more about you than your strongest player
  3. Ask yourself what are your values. If upon examination, you don’t like them, change them. 
  4. Own your values. The rest will follow.
3. Set the standards that matter
  1. Make your expectations clear.
  2. What are the standards and expectations that are important to you? Say so. Be clear. Hold them to it. Everything else is secondary.
4. Work with your team where they are
  1. Before you install a brand new process, ask yourself, “What are they good at? What are the foundational steps needed to do the job required?”
  2. Assess your team’s skills
  3. Don’t worry about the ideal team that you do not have
  4. Your job is to determine how to get your team where they need to be.
5. You don’t have to know everything
  1. Get your designers to teach each other
  2. Figure out what your team needs
  3. Get your team sharing with each other
6. You gotta manage the parents too (i.e. manage up, manage down)
  1. Parents are the ones who pay the fees
  2. Parents == Bosses, stakeholders
  3. The better you understand your customers and stakeholders’ needs, the better (and more supported you can be)
7. Make the play in front of you
  1. Things in the baseball field rarely go as you’d like
  2. If you, as a boss, feel frustrated, how much more your players? Chances are, they’re frustrated and ashamed. Yelling (or fixing it) now won’t make it better.
  3. LESSON: What needs to be done right now and still move forward? It didn’t go as planned. What do we need to do right now to move forward?
8. The last hitter still bats
  1. Everyone has a role. Be honest about their role and deploy them to their best effect.
9. Win with the team you have
  1. There are lots of different ways to succeed
  2. You also have to develop the players you have
  3. Leverage your strengths. Cover your weaknesses. Get to success with the skills you have.
10. Extra innings
  1. Nothing is forever, except your culture
    1. The best designers will move on.
    2. The best people and ideas go to where they are most valuable.
    3. The best teams are a product of a great culture. It’s about creating opportunities that nurture them and lead them to move on (because they’ve gotten so good)

Design management is not for everyone. But if it is, do it with humility, curiosity, and heart.
