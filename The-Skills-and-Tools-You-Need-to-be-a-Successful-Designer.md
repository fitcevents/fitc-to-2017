# The Skills and Tools You Need to be a Successful Designer
It is estimated that 70% of millennials have ‘impostor syndrome’ at work

Worry more if someone tells you they’ve never felt like a fraud. Ultra confident people may simply be too incompetent to realize how incompetent they are (the **Dunning-Kruger Effect**).

But you do have the skills!

**Graphic Design** - design skills, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign (more print-based stuff)
**Web Design** - Photoshop/Illustrator/Sketch, Understanding of JavaScript & frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap), HTML + CSS, Responsive Web Design, familiar with new apps, Adobe XD
**Motion Design** - Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, 3D software (optional), design skills

**Lying on a Resume**

- 58% of employers have caught a lie on a resume (the other 42% weren’t caught)
- “If you sell your expertise you have  alimited repertoire. If you sell your ignorance, you shave an unlimited repertoire. He was selling his ignorance and his desire to learn about a subject. The journey of him going from not knowing to knowing was his work” - Richard Saul Wurman on Charles Eames

**Embrace your inner impostor.**

**Technical skills are fleeting -** the technical skills that you used 5 years ago may not be the ones you’re using today.

**Your Design Fundamentals are timeless. They don’t go out of style.**

  - Don’t add colors to just add colors. 
  - Ask, “What context am I adding these colors?”
