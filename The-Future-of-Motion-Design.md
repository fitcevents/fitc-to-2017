# The Future of Motion Design
With Justin Core 

Justin Core has earned a Degree in Writing and Design 

  **A look ahead**
  What is motion design? 
    It is graphic design and making it animated. Visual communication is more important than problem solving.
    
  Classic example: Shows marvel studio Dr. Strange trailer 
  with typography Malechimp add with Facebook 
  You could do 3D realistic animation 
  Visual essay are animation that use text
  Web is home to a lot of motion design

  Motion design is so important that google has a whole module dedicated to motion graphic on mobile device 
  Motion graphic doesn't always have to be on a rectangle screen could be on face of buildings : now you see me 2
  or faces of human : song videos

**Behold the prediction 1** 

  Why make predictions? Pretty sharp lens on what you're doing right now? 
  CG will eat the world (computer generated) 3D 
  Why is cg appetite growing? 
  Hardware :  GPU does more than CPU 
  Octane and other software are making more usage of this GPUs 
  Renders everything instantly in 3D 
  Industrial light and magic 1962 2 years of code
  Guy to amazing render does tutorial 
  CG builds a good bridge between person and code 
  CG is not a look. It keeps expanding a
  CG is capable of anything. 

**Prediction number 2** 

  Plays seed  matters/buck 
  Dole "the process" blink (indah Harris) then break down of the videos
  Analogue as a term and aesthetic has lost its meaning

**Prediction 3** 

  The web will move 
  iPhone was the death of flash 
  I was sad cause it was death of rich web 
  Web has become a lot of usable but a less exciting 
  Animate 
  Timelines action and scenes 
  [GitHub.com](http://github.com/)\bodymovin 
  Facebook keyframes open source 
  Lets you bring motion graphics to web 

**Prediction 4**

  Motion design will be the visual language for AR 
  Real environment : real , junk 
  Virtual environment: every thing virtual. CG 
  Cinematic vs interactive 
  Cinematic is no touching just seeing 

It's like shooting a sphere with a 360 camera 
**Interactive**: where things is rendered real time. Needs a lot of computer power. 
**Augmented reality**  (mixed reality)  real environment with objects on top of it. 
Meta and daqri : working on AR  
Magic leap raised 1 billion dollar without showing their hardware augmented virtuality. 
AR has reached a point where fog has been lifted. Limitless possibilities 

**Advice**: be honest and to your strengths
   Being interested in something isn't good enough.

Always make an interest skills map 


  1. Start small : Always start small
  2. No, smaller: You lose track of what is small when youâ€™re doing something and realize its too bif. If it is change
  3. Always be learning 
  4. Enroll in classes knowing to be a student not a master 
  For business 
  
1. nimbleness is inversely proportion to size 
2.     Keep team small > give them freedom > let them fail 
3. Technology + people + failures = short term finically loss new capabalutes


Pick a direction and don't stay still.
