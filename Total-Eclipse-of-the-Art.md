## The emotional process of creating anything

with Stephen Martell @sajmartell

**There is an emotional journey when you’re trying to create something amazing**

- Creating anything is really, really, really, really fucking hard
  - Starts as a sketch to the real thing
  - John Saddington, 2016: [“The Emotional Journey of Creating Anything Great”](https://medium.com/@saddington/the-emotional-journey-of-creating-anything-great-b3df948d22c8)
- In the beginning: Honeymoon phase. Everyone is on board!
  - The team feels invincible!
- And then the dip approaches - things are starting to feel difficult
  - Acknowledge that it’s going to be tough
  - Keep sharing progress. Show people it’s going to be difficult.
  - Fail fast
  - Keep prototyping. Iterate!
- Then the bug starts to come - this is not what I planned!
  - Bugs are rolling in
  - People start to distance themselves, bail out, blame outhers
  - Don’t get angry yet! This isn’t rock bottom yet!
  - Reiterate the goal. Revisit the product’s goal and context.
- The Dip - Your confidence escapes you
  - Remember you’re not alone in this project. 
  - You may have to relinquish control and accept help.
  - And it now feels like hell
    - “If people weren’t involved. This would be easy.” - STOP THIS. Chart a path, motivate people, align expectations (it doesn’t mean sacrifice the outcome)
    - Persist! Find humour in the situation.
- You now have a product but it’s prickly
  - It’s working; but full of issues.
  - The sting of getting hurt takes a while to dissipate
  - Earn trust through action
  - Avoid the temptation to end the project here. Fight project fatigue!
  - Prop up those who stuck it out - Getting through the shit together makes you stronger.
  - Think on your feet to add value
- Later on, progress seeps in (and you feel it). And then success.
  - Remember you work with people
  - When things are tough, revert to the objectives than machine talk
  - None of us is as smart as all of us
  - Creativity conquers all!
