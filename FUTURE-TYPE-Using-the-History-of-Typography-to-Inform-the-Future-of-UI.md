# FUTURE TYPE: Using the History of Typography to Inform the Future of UI

## Michelle Cortese

**We will explore:**

- The history of typography as a jumping point for unpacking the future of User Interface
- Consider the nuances of phonetic letterforms and adapt them to gestural, conversational, immersive experiences

**The Latin Alphabet**

- Today’s latin alphabet is actually a 2000+ year old invention of war
- First communication: Oral communication and hieroglyphs 
  - This was the mode of communication until the Phoenicians came along; invented a system of codification, turning phonetic sounds into visual symbols as a means to hide war strategy from the Greeks
  - “Phonetic” == Phoenicians
  - Eventually, the Greeks dominated, took the alphabet, expanded on it, then were succeeded by the Romans who took the alphabet, expanded on it, etc.
  - This led to the creation of the Latin alphabet
- The hash symbol, #
  - Antiquity
    - Late BC. The Romans need a symbol for Libra Pondo (‘pound in weight’)
    - So they started drawing a little “l” and “b” with a bar across the tops of both letters.
    - As scribes started writing faster, the symbol morphed into #
  - 1968
    - Bell Labs’ design problem - the keypad on the newly designed touch tone phone looked weird; the 0 was dangling on the bottom
    - In response, they added keys to either side of the zero, making the keypad a nice even rectangle - the # and * (because computers can recognize them, specifically the QWERTY keyboard)
  - 2007
    - # = “pound” symbol
    - An early Twitter user, Chris Messina, in anticipation of an event called BarCamp tweeted out: “How do you feel about using # (pound) for groups?”
      - People liked it for its ability to deliver searchability
- All those texts on your phone - they’re just representations of sounds
  - Knowing the lineage of Phoenician letterforms is important because it helps us remember what the purpose of interface text really is

We’re hitting a post-truth era where the future of understandable, clear, nuanced, and truthful communication is going to be incredibly important.

**How to reconsider nuances of phonetic letterforms for a future of modular, wearable and alternate reality devices**

- We are the ones who get to scope the parameters and test the potential interactive standards for the future of UI
- Remember: Text isn’t nature
  - It’s a codified communication visualization invented to subvert travel plans
  - It exists in its current form factor because of a history of accidents and random decisions
- Every interaction has a core need resting below it
  - We rely on our text in UI because it became a firm graphic standard

Crucial questions
What is the resent set of communication needs?
What new standards can we teest?
How do we straetgize converting the nuances of phonetic letterforms to immersive UI?
What complex methods and frameworks do we have today to experiment with?

**Two types of Next Generation Interfaces - 0UI and NUI**

- Natural User Interface
  - What is it:
    - Focus on doing (a.k.a. “organic UI”)
    - Interactions are satisfying physical metaphors. 
    - Interaction feels fluid, direct and organic
    - NUI users feel as though they are directly and physically manipulating digital content
  - Elements to consider:
    - Sans-text graphical interactions/interface - universally understandable iconography (e.g. emojis, custom glyphs, a lot like pictographs)
    - Turning gestures into triggers
      - Leveraging movement versus textual demands
      - Tailor the scale of the interaction/gesture to the specific ask or intent
    - Comfort via organic materials
      - Bendable, foldable, displayable, reacts when I turn it on, etc.
      - “Body as button”
  - Zero User Interface
    - What is it:
      - Describes speech-based, screenless interfaces that get to the root of our communications
      - Invisible, personal, and adaptive
    - Elements to consider:
      - Creating satisfying feedback systems 
        - e.g. haptics to denote confirmation and presence
        - Movement as buttontrigger
        - Applying traditional physical buttons/triggers modularly and sparingly
      - Conversationality
        - Broad vocabulary and situational relevance
        - Necessary level of AI needed for interaction in question
        - Machine learning for adaptivity
      - Connectivity
        - Ensure consistent interactions across the interface family/ecosystem

**COnclusion**

- Text is a construct
- Free yourself of typography’s constraints but be inspired with its intent
