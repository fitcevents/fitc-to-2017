# A Human and a Robot Play a Drawing Game
Presented by Sougwen Chung

Events like FITC are great for bringing together people on a collective voyage to great new things.

Describes her work as the "space between the mark made by hand and the mark made by machine"

Sharing the story of how Google’s Alpha GO beat the top human players, years earlier than humans thought AI would be up for this. The GO players, despite being devastated, began reporting how after playing against the AI for months, they started looking at their own games differently. Instead of looking at it as machine vs human, they now view it as machine and human.  Lee Sodol, master Go player, describes the moves of Alpha Go as beautiful.

Drawing is an interface that connects us to something intrinsically human.

**Chiascuro** - her first installation, combining layered drawings and lighting to create 3d forms in the gallery space

**Ecdysis** - projection mapped response on architectural structure that was audio reactive

**Praesentia** - a tool that made it simple for anyone to draw a 3D printable sculpture, making 3D printing accessible to anyone, next just the technically minded.

Early on, computers = automation, but that dichotomy is changing, closer to the Chinese translation of computer: electric brain


## Drawing Operations Unit Gen 1

Created D.O.U.G. a robotic drawing arm that uses a camera to track a human hand drawing. It tracks the motion and style of the drawn lines and adds to the drawing using the same influence.


## D.O.U.G. Gen 2

Even more collaborative, using machine learning, not the old Markov chains, but rather neural networks and more to understand the artist. Can work as collaborator or performer. 
Using Tensorflow, trained with data from Sougwen and the drawings of other artists.

Gen 2 will be fully open source. 

When a human and robot collaborate, the inaccuracies of the robot are not bugs, rather they add to the piece.
