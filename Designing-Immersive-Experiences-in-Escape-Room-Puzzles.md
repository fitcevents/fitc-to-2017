Adam starts by outlining some of the major issues he sees with existing escape rooms: 

Escape games often fail to  draw  knowledge/experience from previous styles of game design (he identifies video games specifically as being a key place to draw inspiration).

Some key points to consider in designing your puzzle room:

- **Consistency** in design is key. 
- **Understanding the players** - surmise what is happening with your players inside of your room.
- **Empathize with your players** - locking people in a room they need to escape causes anxiety - why put your players through it?

Before we can figure out how to improve our puzzles, we most define what a puzzle is:

**As a static and logical challenge which players solve with the assistance of clues.** 

Puzzles being unsolvable as a point of pride makes for a terrible user experience - fun is derived from **solving** the puzzle. 

Arranging puzzles in a correct order results in flow **(Flow is defined as: how you feel, your emotional state)**. Flow is a middle band between frustration and boredom. This is where you want to keep your players.

******What can we learn from video games?**

**Flow** -
Super hard puzzles in a row creating a frustrating relationship creates poor flow. Try to re-arrange your puzzles if you can in a way that prevents the player from getting frustrated.

**Have a tutorial level** 
Ease players into the game, simple puzzles, easy wins to make them feel good.

**Vista moments -** ability for player to admire their success, recollect their thoughts. (Analogous with cinematics after boss battles)


**Troubleshooting**
If you’re having a flow issue, think about it in terms of **video game level design, such as:** 

-  the player’s starting position
- emotional state/inventory/end goal

**Difficulties -** Certain styles of rooms with overwhelm beginner players (rooms with lots of different possible furniture pieces) vs concise rooms (less elements, more straightforward approach

**In puzzle design, consider three/six/nine act story structure, which looks like:**

- Call to action
- Deal with it
- Big, intense, moment
- Victory or failure

Look elsewhere for inspiration - books, travel, other puzzle formats, theatre, etc.

Players often get distracted - so remember to constantly check back and make sure your game has good flow - you can accomplish this by checking your story, finding where puzzles overlap, and re-ordering the puzzles for better flow.

Provide feedback to players that helps them to understand the connection between an action that they’re performing and the subsequent result we want to accomplish.

**Stop thinking you’re smart.** Players don’t know your personal biasses, how you process information, whatever obscure references feel like common knowledge to you.

**Prototype, play test, repeat!**
