# The Do's and Don'ts of Motion Design Domination
The dos and don'ts of motion design
*With Erin Sarofsky*
 
Designers solve problems brought by others. 
Design driven production
Work in progress: It could look really bad in process but what some people don't realize is the final product into an awesome looking project 
Design can be so much more than just your something on your phone. 
 
My dos and don'ts 

1. Have a concept
2. Don't clutter it up - be simple - know when you have all the elements 
3. Don't forget the fundamentals- composition, colors - big thing you're designer first and motion designer second 
4. Do set a tone - 
5. Don't make assumptions 
6. Do good (when you can) - we have to make money but we have a platform use it for good
7. Don't be a mess -

Don't like 

1. don't forget you're a part of a team - not alone and communicative with team members how long it's going to take you to do 
2. Don't assume the client is a moron - make sure they are part of process -  if they are finish the project and never work with them again 
3. Remember, era design is an opinion - you don't need a degree for opinion - if client wants a certain type of color but it's worst option don't tell them that drive them to a better solution
