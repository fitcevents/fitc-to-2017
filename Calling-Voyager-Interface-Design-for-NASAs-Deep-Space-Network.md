**Design Challenge of NASA**

- Combination of old/new technology, needs to be compatible.
- Designs need to last 20 years.

**DSN: Deep Space Network**

- Phoneline to spacecraft
- 13 antennas (?) right now
- Manned 24/7
- Allows for photos of/from space
- Mostly male/older. 8% is female (6 women)
- Highly technical, not IT people. Not early adopters of technologies
- Highly educated
- Their job is to point the antenna at the space craft at the appropriate time. Very tedious, long times just staring at screens

Challenge of situational awareness - how to design for a vigilance task? How to keep operators alert?

Traditionally, operators haven’t used digital interfaces, more tangible interactions (analog dials with audio feedback). Makes them a change-resistant user. “Every time you change something you’re used to, it introduces risk and delay. In this case, that risk could be losing data, or someone’s death.” Users aren’t familiar with screens and can’t make a decision in time.

Three cultures in three sites, there are regional differences and clique differences. The same can be said when designing for sales teams, doctors, etc. These are things to consider when designing.

**Follow the Sun**

- Changes happening at site that has daylight. Minimizing risk.
- Allows operators to work normal shifts, no midnight/overnight shifts.
- Still, for operators, this is scary and different.
- Tripling the workload for operators, each will now monitor 3 dishes, each with multiple spacecraft at the other end.

**Designing for Change: What Didn’t Work**

- Big changes with no user research - must be designed around user’s needs
- Drastic changes without good reason - off-putting for change-resistant users, even with aesthetic design
- Changes, with good reason, but too drastic - off-putting for change-resistant users, doesn’t create user trust, seems suspicious
- “User Acceptance Testing” - don’t do it. Waterfall term that makes sense when shipping flight software. Must be QA’d for a year before going on spacecraft. Doesn’t make sense for when there’s more than 1 user.

**Designing for Change: What Worked**

- Involve early, involve often - sketch on iPad, show to operators before building any of it
- Build trust - let users know you’ll listen to them, engage in active communication, especially with change-resistant users
- Iterations
- Slow and steady wins the race

**Techniques**

- User interviews - talking to users, changing result by being in a room with it
- Observations - fishbowl rooms
- Experiential research - actually do the user’s job with the user
- Paper prototypes - low-fidelity looks like something the user can influence. Simply tasks, contribute.
- Participatory design - ask users what can make their job better/easier? 
- “Paper Dolls” - set up paper versions of displays with multiple windows, multiple screens. Consider screen real estate, identify risks in the 3 link processd.
- Did some tests with simple changes to the skin of the existing UI and were able to improve operator performance as much as 50% with nothing more than colour and font tweaks.
- Create relationships with the users, get to know them, ask for pictures of their kids, bake them banana bread, make them want to share and engage with you.
- Cultivating ambassadors
- Banana Bread
