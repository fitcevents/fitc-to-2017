# WTF is Mixed Reality?
We have physical reality, based on atoms, and digital reality, of artificially created sensory experiences. The combination of these is mixed reality.

Mixed reality spectrum moves from physical reality all the way to digital reality. Bringing something from one into another creates a new reality, called mixed reality. Right now, AR is mostly physical, and VR is mostly digital.

Holographic headsets (see-through, not completely opaque) and immersive headsets (occluded) are mixed reality. 

Windows mixed reality offers the broadest range of experiences.

Users eventually, psychologically, think digital assets are real (such as a digital puppy in the doorway).

These new experiences are poised for rapid growth. 75 million headsets proposed to be sold by 2020.

Head mounted displays (HMDs), 2 types of headsets: see-through and occluded. Seeing a lot of uptake in commercial applications of HDMs. Windows 10 allows for appealing 360 environments.

Holographic headsets

  -Untethered computer
  -Transparent lenses
  -New holographic processing unit
  -Spatial sound

Immersive headsets

  -Works out-of-box
  -Wide range of affordable options
  -Largest apps library, because it’s a Windows 10 device everything is compatible

Advanced tech, inside-out tracking, 6DOF

Use Cases

  -Creation/design
  -Assembly/manufacturing
  -Training/dev
  -Communication/understanding (pairing)
  -Entertainment/engagement

What makes it different?

  -Freedom of movement
  -Singe, consistent UI, not hard to learn (present across Windows 10 devices)
  -Effortless setup
  -One SDK for many devices
  -Windows store for MR apps

Consistent with Universal Windows Platform

Familiar development tools (Vis Studio, Universal Dev Center)

Input Diversity

  -Gaze
  -Gesture
  -Game pads
  -Mouse/keyboard
  -Voice (Cortana is built in)
  -Spatial mapping (space between walls, etc)
  -Spatial sound

Get started through the HoloLens emulator. You need:

  -visual studio
  -64-bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education with 64-bit CPU
  -8GB RAM, GPU
  Windows 10 SDK

Emulator has a simulation tab, important for debugging. Rooms can be pulled or start with default rooms.

Port existing VR apps to Windows MR

  -Code checklist: port your app to UWP, validate middleware
  -Design considerations: design assets for the MR shell. Go for a low-poly experience. Evaluate Windows MR functionality. Focus on consistent performance and frame rate target.
  -Testing and publishing: validate performance across a range of PC’s
