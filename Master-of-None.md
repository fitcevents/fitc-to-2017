# Master of None
"Master" means a young boy who is too young to be called "mister". Jack of all trades, master of none is an insult often directed at Olaf

"Polymath" is a nicer way to say the same thing, someone who wants to learn as much as they can

Bring your process to your demo reel

Understand what you don't know. Learn and sacrifice.

When the student is ready, the teacher appears. No one is "self-taught". You use resources.

The biggest takeaway from school was how to learn. How do **you** learn vs how do you **learn**? Olaf changed the names of video game characters as a form of learning/studying

Learn every fucking day. Fail soon, fail early, get better. Doing something every day keeps you accountable. You won't notice at first, but give it time and you'll learn a ton.

The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

To go fast, go alone. To go far, go together.

The road to less is paved with more.

Less time spent on something should not equal less money. Know your worth. "It took your 5 seconds to make that." "No, it took me my whole life." < Picasso quote. Remember how long it took you to get to this point.

Know everything about something, and something about everything.

Plus minus equal system: always have someone above you to look up to, under you to mentor, and equal to you as a peer."
