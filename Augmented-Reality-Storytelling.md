AR Storytelling is beginning to move past astonishment of technology, and beginning to ask - what makes a good story? 

AR Storytelling is a visual experience, but important not to abandon other senses - hearing, touche, taste, smell. Reality is all of these things, and for storytelling to create an immersive experience other senses need to be integrated.

In *Augmented Human*, Papagiannis outlines 11 Storytelling Conventions:


1. **Virtual Try On** - Trying on makeup (Sephora and Modiface). Also an expressive mode (Snapchat, Facebook AR Studio which allows you to create masks).
2. **Ghosts** - Recurring theme in AR. Making the invisible visible - opportunity for storytelling to explore fantastical, beyond reality.
3. **Living pictures** - Making the inanimate animate - like “Harry Potter Portraits”. See this with AR magazines and newspapers.
4. **Hole in the Wall** - Something emerging from a hole in the wall - a VR character coming into your space. Optical illusion. Somehow change your physical environment (Microsoft Hololens).
5. **XRay Vision** - extending our capacity of human vision to see through the world in new ways (Poloanatomy, allows you to see through skin and how organs and muscles work)
6. **3D Drawing** - use tools in a way you already know how in order to create an augmented reality experience. (Quiver, AR Coloring Book)
7. **Artistic Filters** - Facebook Live, Artisto, stylistic transfer-  combines AR and AI to change the world around you.
8. **Shared Space** - AR for the most part is single user experience. Shared Space is 2 way, multiuser. For work/play. Holoportation 3d capture technology for meetings in shared space.
9. **Objects Telling Stories** - Apps like Blippers Visual Discovery - think of family heirlooms that could tell you their history or past.
10. **Action Galleries** - about an act of play - on Hololens with Actiongram - characters are animated and you can place them in your physical surroundings.
11. **Avatars -** Like Bitmoji - ‘like seeing your friend’. Going to see avatars in AR as a way to personalize communication. Oculus avatars. Photo realistic avatars coming up (company ‘Uraniom’). Holoportation is a live 3d capture system (copresence), Uraniom is pre-made characters you can plug and play across AR/VR/Videogames.

**What makes a good AR story?**

1. It moves you
2. It shifts your perspective
3. Get you talking, telling the story of the story.
