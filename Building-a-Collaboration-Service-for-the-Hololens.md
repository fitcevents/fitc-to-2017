# Building a Collaboration Service for the Hololens
*With Cyrille Fauvel*

Working at Autodesk since 1993 
**Passion for design** 

**Emerging Technology**

  **Mission** : Explore the intersection of emerging tech and market trends to provide Autodesk potential directions for innovative design, business and technology solutions.
  **Focus:** Enterprise apps in Augmented, Mixed and Virtual Reality. Interactive ‘Real-time 3D Experiences and Storytelling’

  With HoloLens we are facing problems.
-  We need new easy gestures. 
- We need a new way of interacting because it’s important to tell interactive stories at the end. 
- We want people to interact using with mixed reality with their mobile device. 

Normal input device: Mouse, Keyboard. Your interaction is limited you can only use mouse keyboard only.

  You have to design a smooth experience for user for them to have smooth storytelling experience

  When looking for a house online you only see the house from outside. It looks nice. How do you know: 
  1. How it is from inside?
  2. Does it even fit your needs? 

 
That's what we are trying to make in 3D using your mobile device, and making it interactive. 

Iron man inspired jet fighter helmet with AR but it costs $400,000. No one is going to buy it.

In 1993 Autodesk did the first VR. It was in a newspaper story that its heavy. Really heavy could render 4FPS in real time.

 AR is what we have now.
 
VR is virtual. nothing real everything is designed in 3D. 

AR device you're interacting with real world. 
For instance, AR has meaning I could be looking at a ceiling and place stuff there. Now, everytime I look at that ceiling it's going to check my location and put everything on that ceiling and let me interact with it with gestures.

Our first 3D modeled and printed VR -

where we started from. 
It's a really good experience.
 You can buy Google cardboard for just $20 and have a really good VR experience. 

**Autodesk live** 
The only product that came live after all research that takes revit file and makes it interactive 3D.

We used drones to take pictures of really big land, made a mesh and made it interactive in  HTC VIVE, Autodesk Vred provides 

**Automotive experience**. 
People want really fine rendering instead and experience 

When you start with automotive industry you start collaborating work. You want to share what you're doing.

Interactive design is when you put elements around in virtual world.
And bio major molecule-When you doing research prof are interested to see what the virus looks like, because they only see really small pictures with a microscope. 
In VR it's human size so prof can see clearly. 

**Sketching** 
**Model preparation** 

- Model preparation easily the biggest AR/VR pain-point
- UV mapping, material texturing and polygon optimization
- A week’s worth of effort for a typical model

**Forge Viewer**

- Version >=2.12 support webVR
  - enable the WebVr extension in your app
  - Icon appears webVR-compatible device found
  - Oculus Rift, HTC vive and google cardboard
- Currently a “first person” view
  - working on turntable navigation for “widget” viewing
  - will make it suitable for use in Vrok-it  

We can 3D model in virtual world. If you're making a game monster it's ok cause it doesn't need to be precise, because 3D modelling in not there yet- not precise. 

It converts any 3D file to Json file. Once in Jason you can use it using API and have all the information.

If you use your phone you can have VR with this experience right away no coding. 

If we take a mechanical piece in the AR world, you can interact with element, select it move it, you can discuss with any one and that's collaborating.

 If you have a 3D house and make it big enough you can go inside and and explore like kitchen etc
