**MAIN FOCUS: How is data becoming a material for creative expression?**

- often feels like a battle between the qualitative and the quantitative
- But it doesn’t have to be that way!

**Charts and Graphs**

- Jessica Hagy’s graphs (published on Index)

Catalogtree treats data visualization from an editorial perspective

“Dear Data” (by Lupi and Posavec) - data can make us more humane and connect with people at a deeper level

******Language as Data**

- Sosolimited’s Reconstitution 2008

**Data as Conductor**

**Turning the London Eye into a Mood Ring for the Olympics**

- Used a sentiment analysis on Twitter 
  - Rate sentiment from 0-4, scored emoticons too, punctuations and incorrect spelling bore on the rating too + an engine that captured these data
  - Took 24 hour data and presented it in 24 minutes (visually)

**Beyond the Screen**

- See Ekene Ijeoma’s Wage Islands - visualizes the affordability of New York City
- Sosolimited’s Fusion Choir
