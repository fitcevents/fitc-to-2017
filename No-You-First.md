# No, You First
Director of Social Media, Innocean Worldwide Canada

“I spend a lot of time thinking about feelings. Specifically, your feelings.”

Been working in social media for 10 years, in a variety of fields
Thinks about how things are presented to us. Doesn’t have ad blocker, wants to see what pops up and why.

**The Start**

  -Got into thinking about targeted marking when she incorrectly received a targeted ad for maternity wear.
  -Targeting algorithm seemed more sophisticated, because she fits a demographic who **might** expect to be expecting.
  -The targeted ad could be upsetting to someone who is trying, but can’t get pregnant
  -An imperfect system; empathy is missing

**Empathy is a misunderstood thing.**

  -Empathy is not sympathy, and it’s not compassion
  -It’s feeling **with** someone
  -Feel with the people you’re marketing to
  -This is why social media has become what it is; you invite someone to put themselves in your life
  -It’s why we feel like we know people better than we do
  -The core is that we share ourselves in a very curated way

**Push vs Pull**

  -Broadcast vs conversation
  -Consumers should want to participate
  -’Pay to Play’ changed everything
  -If we have the budget, we should pay to appear in feeds
  -TV adapts, more print ads online, more spam appear
  -This made us move away from trying to connect with consumers
  -Think billboard vs junk mail
    -A billboard is placed in an area because the target market is in that area. It speaks to the audience.
    -Junk mail feels offensive, when it’s absolutely of no relevance and is intruding in your space.
    -Impersonal ads feel like junk mail

**Human vs Try-Hard**

  -We reach out to humans, but we are brands, not friends
  -Be familiar and relevant, but not too much where it seems like we’re trying too hard
  -Our competition isn’t our competitors, its users’ other content. Our ads shouldn’t be so disruptive to a user’s content that they get annoyed.
  -Knowing our consumers is important

**Empathy**

  -Do we understand our target’s values?
    -Example: Pepsi
  -Do we understand our target’s needs?
  -Do we understand our target’s experiences?
  -Do we understand our target’s beliefs?
    -People don’t like to have their world views challenged. You don’t want to see what you don’t agree with
  -Do we think our target will believe this?

**What happens when we listen to what consumers care about?**

  -Example: Chick N’ Mix bath bomb from Lush. Lush has strong company values, their entire company is built around the idea of fresh and real ingredients, they’re transparent about how everything is made.
  -Example: American Apparel. The original idea was that everything was made in the USA, not in sweatshops.

**Empathy adds value.**

  -Makes it easier to explain why things cost as much as they do

**What happens when we look only at our target?**

  -Ads targeted towards moms vs dads. Dads are treated like idiots.
  -Cheerios came out with a campaign called How to Dad. Mom is still making the purchasing decisions, but reaching out to Dad.

**Empathy creates new consumers.**

**What happens when we only look at data?**

  -We’re not looking at the larger picture.
  -Example: Fiverr. Misguided marketing. Designers are freelancers because companies don’t want to hire long-term, and this means people lose healthcare, etc. And yet Fiverr is advertising that this is the ideal.

**Empathy creates connection.**

**What happens when we look at our target’s experiences?**

  -Most people have insecurities, body issues, etc
  -Example: the beauty industry is built on people (women) hating themselves. Dove campaign tried to combat this by building a campaign around daily affirmations.

**Empathy reassures.**

**What happens when we look beyond the obvious?**

  -Example: IKEA, simplifying furniture. Shaping campaign around Google searches.

**Empathy provides solutions, and create a new role for your brand.**

**How can we develop empathy?**

  -Example: Millennial Mom. Consider preoccupations, environment, influences, behavior. Blow out a notion of who she is to understand what she needs in life.
  -Get offline. Go outside. Interface face-to-face.
  -Find your target and lurk.
  -Use your data to build a world for yourself.
  -Get an understanding of why.
  -Find parallels in your own life.

**Always think the best of your target. Don’t judge.**

**Let’s talk about selfies.**

  -People think its narcissistic. 
  -Why not feel joy in loving yourself?

**Making real things for real people feels good.**
